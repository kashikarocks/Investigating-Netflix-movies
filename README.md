📊 Investigating Netflix Movies – Data Analysis Project
This project is part of my exploratory data analysis (EDA) journey where I analyze Netflix’s movie dataset to uncover interesting insights about films released in the 1990s decade.

🎯 Project Objectives
Find the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s and store it as an integer value (duration).

Identify short action movies (runtime < 90 minutes) released in the 1990s and count them (short_movie_count).

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand trends in Netflix’s movie collection during this nostalgic era.

🛠️ Skills & Tools Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) for data analysis and visualization

Data Wrangling: filtering by decade, cleaning, and handling categorical features

Exploratory Data Analysis: analyzing durations, genres, and distribution of movies

Visualization: plotting histograms and frequency counts to uncover trends

📌 Key Learnings
Hands-on experience in data preprocessing and filtering by conditions (decade, runtime, genre).

Learned how to compute descriptive statistics and generate insights (most common duration, short movie counts).

Built visualizations to effectively communicate insights from raw data.

🚀 Why This Project?
Netflix is a global leader in entertainment, and analyzing its dataset provided me with a real-world opportunity to practice data-driven storytelling. This project highlights my ability to extract valuable insights
from data, a skill crucial for data analyst and data scientist roles.
